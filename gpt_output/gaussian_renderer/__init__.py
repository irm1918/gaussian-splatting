    """
    Renders the scene from a given viewpoint.

    This function takes in a viewpoint camera, a Gaussian model of the scene, a pipeline configuration,
    a background color tensor, a scaling modifier, and an optional override color. It performs the 
    rendering process by setting up the rasterization configuration, computing the 3D covariance and 
    colors if necessary, and finally rasterizing the visible Gaussians to an image. The function returns 
    a dictionary containing the rendered image, the screenspace points, a visibility filter, and the 
    radii of the Gaussians.

    Args:
        viewpoint_camera: The camera from which the scene is viewed.
        pc (GaussianModel): The Gaussian model of the scene.
        pipe: The pipeline configuration.
        bg_color (torch.Tensor): The background color tensor. Must be on GPU.
        scaling_modifier (float, optional): A modifier for the scaling of the scene. Defaults to 1.0.
        override_color (optional): If provided, this color will be used instead of the computed colors.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary containing the rendered image, the screenspace points, a visibility filter,
              and the radii of the Gaussians.
