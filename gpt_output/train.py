        opt: Optimization parameters for the model.
        pipe: Pipeline parameters for the model.
        testing_iterations: List of iterations at which the model should be tested.
        saving_iterations: List of iterations at which the model should be saved.
        checkpoint_iterations: List of iterations at which a checkpoint should be created.
        checkpoint: Path to the checkpoint file to be loaded.
