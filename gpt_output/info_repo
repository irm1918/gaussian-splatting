info about repository:
This repository contains the official implementation of the paper "3D Gaussian Splatting for Real-Time Radiance Field Rendering". The paper introduces a method for real-time rendering of radiance fields using 3D Gaussian splatting. The method aims to achieve high visual quality while maintaining competitive training times and enabling real-time rendering at 1080p resolution. The methodology consists of three key elements: representing the scene with 3D Gaussians, performing interleaved optimization and density control of the Gaussians, and developing a fast visibility-aware rendering algorithm. The repository includes code for the optimizer, network viewer, real-time viewer, and a script for converting images into optimization-ready SfM datasets. The codebase has been tested on Windows 10 and Ubuntu Linux 22.04. The repository also provides pre-trained models and evaluation images for testing and evaluation purposes. The implementation is based on PyTorch and CUDA extensions and requires a CUDA-ready GPU with Compute Capability 7.0+ and 24 GB VRAM for training to paper evaluation quality. The repository provides step-by-step tutorials, pre-built Windows binaries, and detailed instructions for installation and usage. The code is released under a non-commercial license, allowing free use for research and evaluation purposes.
