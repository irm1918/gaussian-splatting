    """
    Measures the Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS) between two input tensors.

    This function is used to compare the similarity between two images in terms of their perceptual
    and structural characteristics. It uses a pre-trained model specified by the 'net_type' parameter
    to extract features from the images, and then computes the distance between these feature
    representations to determine the LPIPS.

    Args:
        x (torch.Tensor): The first input tensor (image) to compare.
        y (torch.Tensor): The second input tensor (image) to compare.
        net_type (str, optional): The type of pre-trained network to use for feature extraction.
            Options include 'alex', 'squeeze', and 'vgg'. Default is 'alex'.
        version (str, optional): The version of LPIPS to use. Default is '0.1'.

    Returns:
        torch.Tensor: The LPIPS distance between the two input images.
