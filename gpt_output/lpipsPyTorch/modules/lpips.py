    """Creates a criterion that measures Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS).

    This class is used to create a criterion that measures the Learned Perceptual Image Patch
    Similarity (LPIPS) between two images. The LPIPS is a perceptual similarity metric that 
    compares the features of two images using a pretrained network and linear layers.

    Args:
        net_type (str): The type of the network to be used for feature comparison. It can be 
                        'alex', 'squeeze', or 'vgg'. Default is 'alex'.
        version (str): The version of LPIPS to be used. Currently, only '0.1' is supported. 
                       Default is '0.1'.

        This method takes two images as input and computes the LPIPS between them. It first

        difference and averages the result.
